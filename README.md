# Flux-Interpolated-Advection

This is an implementation of the our CGI paper "A Flux-Interpolated Advection Scheme for Fluid Simulation" (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-021-02187-2).
This code depends on the external library Eigen and amgcl. Please place the Eigen and amgcl codes on the include directory.
